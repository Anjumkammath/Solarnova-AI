🧠 Core Workflow of SolarNova AI
At the heart of SolarNova AI is a real-time automation loop that integrates computer vision and embedded control to ensure autonomous solar panel maintenance. Here's how it works:

📸 Live Frame Capture
Utilizes OpenCV to continuously stream video from a connected USB or Pi camera, monitoring the surface of the solar panel.

🖼️ Preprocessing
Each captured frame is resized to 224x224 pixels, converted into a NumPy array, and normalized using preprocess_input to match the input requirements of MobileNetV2.

🤖 Inference with TensorFlow Lite
The preprocessed frame is passed to a TensorFlow Lite model, fine-tuned to classify the panel condition as either "clean" or "dirt".

🚨 Detection & Threshold Logic
If the model predicts "dirt" with a confidence score greater than 90%, the system initiates a cleaning routine.

⚙️ Motor Control & Cleaning Mechanism
Cleaning is performed by a stepper motor connected via GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. The motor activates a rotating brush mechanism, managed by the rotate() and clean() functions, ensuring thorough dust removal.

🛑 Safety & Termination
The system provides a live video feed for monitoring and can be safely terminated at any point by pressing the 'q' key on the keyboard.

This intelligent automation loop ensures that solar panels are consistently maintained at peak efficiency—without the need for manual intervention.
SolarNova AI embodies a smart, scalable, and eco-friendly solution for modern energy systems
