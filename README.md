# Solarnova AI : Automatic Dust Detection &amp; Cleaning System implemented on a solar panel

SolarNova AI is an automated, AI-powered system that detects dust on solar panels using MobileNet (CNN model) and triggers a cleaning mechanism using servo motors. Designed for embedded systems like Raspberry Pi, it offers a smart, sustainable solution to maintain the efficiency of solar energy harvesting with zero manual intervention. Solar Nova AI is an intelligent system designed to detect dirt accumulation on solar panels and automatically trigger a cleaning mechanism using a Raspberry Pi, stepper motors, and a fine-tuned deep learning model.
