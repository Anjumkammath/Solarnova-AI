Core Workflow of SolarNova AI
At the core of SolarNova AI is an intelligent real-time loop that integrates computer vision and embedded control to enable autonomous solar panel maintenance. The process works as follows:

Live Frame Capture
The system uses OpenCV to continuously stream video from a connected USB or Raspberry Pi camera, monitoring the surface of the solar panel.

Preprocessing
Each captured frame is resized to 224x224 pixels, converted into a NumPy array, and normalized using preprocess_input to match the input requirements of MobileNetV2.

Inference with TensorFlow Lite
The preprocessed frame is passed to a TensorFlow Lite model, which has been fine-tuned to classify the panel condition as either "clean" or "dirt".

Detection and Threshold Logic
If the model predicts the panel as "dirt" with a confidence score above 90%, the system automatically initiates the cleaning mechanism.

Motor Control and Cleaning Mechanism
A stepper motor, connected via GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi, drives a rotating brush to clean the panel. This operation is managed by the rotate() and clean() functions.

Safety and Termination
The system provides a live video feed for monitoring and can be safely terminated at any time by pressing the 'q' key on the keyboard.

This fully automated workflow ensures consistent panel cleanliness and optimal energy efficiency without requiring manual intervention. SolarNova AI delivers a smart, scalable, and sustainable solution for solar energy maintenance.
